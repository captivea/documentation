# Points

Points provide a way for contacts to be properly weighted. These points have both triggers and actions. Each term will be properly defined and a thorough understanding of how points function will ensure that your overall marketing automation process is successful.

### Point Actions

Point actions are those times when a contact receives a change in their point total. These actions can be either positive or negative point changes and are based on a particular action as you determine.

A partial list can be seen in the screenshot below.

Please note that an action can only be triggered once upon each contact.
For example, you can't create for now a general rule to add 10 points each time a contact download any asset, the action and points modifications will be launched when the contact download his First Asset concerned by the Actions Rule.

You can choose which published Score Category (see below) will be affected by your action using the Score Category's dropdown. Leave Global Score to modify the Contact's default Score.

Clearly these actions can be expanded upon as needed. 
This is the essence of point actions. 

The other part of the points system are the triggers. They are defined next.

### Point Triggers

Point triggers are resulting events which are fired based on the achieved point total of a contact.

In simple terms, when a contact reaches a minimum number of points, the point trigger is fired and an action is performed.
Please note the trigger can concerns the Contact's Global Score or any published Score Category (see below).

When creating a point trigger you have the option to apply the trigger to all existing and applicable contacts as well as new contacts.

These point triggers and associated events are also fully customizable.
